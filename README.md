# PyGame Tutorial

## Origin Acknowledgement
This project was created by me, BStew794, but I am coding this based off a tutorial from the Youtuber "Clear Code" from 2 years ago (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&list=WL&index=2).

## Summary and Purpose
The purpose is to teach me some of the basics of the Pygame library for Python after I attempted to jump in on my own unique project and got off track trying to do everything manually myself including a frustrating collision system. The game is fully playable with music, jump sounds, and animations currently. Unforunately, the graphics and sounds are not my own but from Clear Code's repo. Considering that it is simple pixel art, I may try my own hand at drawing some replacements since I now know the dimesions. Some of the logic is more custom to my particular taste and style. I plan to continue to add more of my own special logic, and I would like to practice training some machine learning agents to play the game eventually. For this reason, A license is included for your convience, in case you want to clone the repository and do some of your own work on it.

As of right now, I plan to let this project sit while I go learn more about PyGame Masks for near pixel perfect collision before returning to the python version of my spaceship combat game.
