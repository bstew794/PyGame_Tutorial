Hello User,

This project was created by BStew794, but I am coding this based off a tutorial from Youtuber Clear Code from 2 years ago (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&list=WL&index=2).

The purpose is to teach me some of the basics of the Pygame library for Python after I attempted to jump in on my own unique project and got off track trying to do everything manually myself including a frustrating collision system.
